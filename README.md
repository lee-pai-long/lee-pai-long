# Lee Pai Long a.k.a Saidina MOHAMED ALI

Hello, World! Je suis **Lee Pai Long** a.k.a **Saidina MOHAMED ALI**.<br>
A senior software engineer speciliazed in *Python(Flask, Django)*.<br>
I use *Linux* as my main OS, love *Git*, use *React* for frontend development,<br>
*AWS* as cloud provider, *Pulumi* for cloud provisioning and *Ansible/Ansistrano* for deployment.

Some time ago, I chose software engineering as my Kung-fu.<br>
Since then I try to achieve knowledge and skills through patience and practice.

The way I try to learn is deeply linked in the **Shu Ha Ri** concept.

**Shu Ha Ri** is a Japanese martial art concept, and describes the stages of learning to mastery.<br>
The word shuhari roughly translates to "first learn, then detach, and finally transcend."

**Shu:** The disciple learns the fundamentals by following the rules issued by the master.

**Ha:** Having mastered the fundamentals, the disciple applies the rules by questioning them,<br>
        understanding their subtleties and seeking exceptions.

**Ri:** The disciple having mastered the rules, can transcend and adapt them to their needs/desires.

In Computer Science / Software engineering the **Ha** is sometimes<br>
refered to as the [the journeyman][1], and the journeyman never ends...

So I try to learn, then adapt, to the needs, the holy requirements, I try to be like water:

> Be like water making its way through cracks.<br>
> Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it.<br>
> If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.<br>
> Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water.<br>
> If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.<br>
> You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle.<br>
> You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.<br>
> Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
- Bruce Lee
