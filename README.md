# Lee Pai Long a.k.a Saidina MOHAMED ALI

Hello, World! Je suis Lee Pai Long a.k.a Saidina MOHAMED ALI.<br>
A senior software engineer speciliazed in Python(Flask, Django).<br>
I also do frontend with React and DevOps with Pulumi and Ansible.<br>
Some time ago, I chose software engineering as my Kung-fu.<br>
Since then I try to achieve knowledge and skills through patience and practice.<br>

The way I try to learn is deeply linked in the **Shu Ha Ri** concept.<br>

**Shu Ha Ri** is a Japanese martial art concept, and describes the stages of learning to mastery.
The word shuhari roughly translates to "first learn, then detach, and finally transcend."

**Shu:** The disciple learns the fundamentals by following the rules issued by the master.

**Ha:** Having mastered the fundamentals, the disciple applies the rules by questioning them, understanding their subtleties and seeking exceptions.

**Ri:** The disciple having mastered the rules, can transcend and adapt them to their needs/desires.

In Computer Science / Software engineering the **Ha** is sometimes refered to as the [the journeyman][1], and the journeyman][1] never ends...

So I try to learn, then adapt, to the needs, the holy requirements, to be like water:

> Be like water making its way through cracks. 
> Do not be assertive,
> but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it.
> If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.
> Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water.
> If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup.
> You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle.
> You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot.
> Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.
- Bruce Lee
